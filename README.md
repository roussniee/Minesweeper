<h1>Minesweeper Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a personal coding challenge, I built a fully functional Minesweeper game in C++ using object-oriented principles. The game supports dynamic grid sizes, custom mine counts, and follows the classic rule set.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- C++ (game logic, I/O)
- STL containers and algorithms
- Console graphics (ASCII rendering)
- Custom game engine logic (flood fill, flagging, mine placement)

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 10

<h2>Contributions </h2>

- Designed the game board using matrix data structures
- Implemented core game rules including cascading zeroes and win/lose detection
- Used modular functions for input validation, rendering, and game state management
- Added replay and difficulty selection functionality

<h2>âœ… Outcome</h2>

-  Reinforced C++ fundamentals including memory management and modularization
-  Created a playable game that mimics the original Minesweeper experience
- Laid groundwork for a future GUI version or cross-platform port
